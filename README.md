## Health Insurance

Introduction:

The health insurance dataset contains 1338 rows of data around people's age, sex, bmi, smoking habits, number of children, and insurance charges.

## Objective

1. Predict which group is most likely to pay high insurance charges to design add-on products and services that optimize the value for customers.

2. Explore patterns in insurance charges by age to tailor marketing campaigns.

3. Determine which region is most likely to show an increased healthcare demand so that we can optimize our investment efforts.

## ETL Process

Extraction
The Jupyter Notebook contains the extraction phase of the ETL process. I downloaded the source data, loaded it onto VSCode for exploration, conducted a correlation analysis, and created a copy for transformation.

At a high-level, I understood that of all the variables in the dataset, smoking has the highest impact on insurance charges. However, age, bmi, sex, seem to significantly impact insurance charges. The next stage of analysis will establish this. 


Transformation
Transformed two variables by inferring insights from the available data. This helped me meet Objective 1 and 2. For Objective 3, I used visualizations to detremine the potential for each region.

Load
Checked the feature_engineered_insurance.csv file for missing data, created a column legend, listed my assumptions and next step.

## Reflection and lessons learned

1. In hindsight, I feel like I spent a lot of time setting up the project, especially in the extraction phase.
    1.a. Going further, day 0 or a day before the project will be the day for me to analyze the incoming task and preparing the project board.

2. Analyze data from multiple perspective. Use existing tools to understand why something works and why something does not work.
    2.a. As this is the first time, there was a learning curve in terms of understand what each stage comprises. 

3. Commit more often.

## Resources

I used the LMS and I've mentioned the instance. I also used GitHub copilot to understand codes and feature-engineering options.

## Thanks

Thanks to Julian for inspiring me and the entire class for bein supportive.
